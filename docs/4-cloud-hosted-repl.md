## Running the bot on repl.it

the first thing to do after creating the reddit app is to fork the repo on repl.it https://repl.it/@igosad/reddit-karma-farming-bot

then just run the the run button

the bot will start downloading the needed deps and then ask for the reddit app credentials and create an .env file 


then you have to delete the first line of the .env file (the bot will break if you dont delete it )

then just run the bot again using the run button 

now you have to ping the repl so it does not shutdown using monitoring system like uptime robot https://uptimerobot.com/

create an account and hit the add new monitor button
