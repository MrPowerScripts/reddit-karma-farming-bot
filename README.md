## Configuration

Most of these options can be configured in [utils.py](src/utils.py)

## Prep ðŸ”ˆ(!!YOU MUST DO THIS FIRST!!)ðŸ”ˆ

First, you need to create a Reddit account, and then create an app on reddit.com. After creating a Reddit account [go here to create an app](https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). follow step 1 [of this guide](https://hackernoon.com/build-a-serverless-reddit-bot-in-3-steps-with-node-js-and-stdlib-sourcecode-e5296b78fc64) to learn how to create the app and get your app details such as client ID and secret


## Heroku
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/psywarrior1998/reddit-karma-farming-bot)

**Important Note: If you restart the Heroku Dyno it will reset the database. Heroku is good if you have absolutely no coding experience at all and just want to see it in action. Otherwise, you're better off installing and running the bot on Ubuntu**

After deploying it and it says deployed click on `Manage App` Button

Now click `Resources` tab

Click on the `Edit` Icon and turn on the worker and save

Click on `more` and `view logs` to make sure everything is fine

That's it, Your Free Hosting is complete!

## Windows 10 (WSL2)

Please look here for a detailed guide to running on windows 10 / Linux. The other guides in this readme also work, but this is more step-by-step.
